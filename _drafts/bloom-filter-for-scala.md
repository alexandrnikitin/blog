### TL;DR

[The source code on github][github-source]  
The fastest implementation for JVM. Take me straight to the benchmarks  
No memory limits, therefore no limits to the number of elements and false positive rate.  
Extendable - plug-in any hash algorithm or element type to hash.  

### Intro

>"A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not. In other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed," says [Wikipedia][wiki-bloom-filter].

What's Bloom filter in a nutshell:

- Optimization for memory. It comes into play when the whole set doesn't fit into memory.
- Solves the membership problem. It can answer one question: does an element belong to a set or not?
- Probabilistic (lossy) data structure. It can answer that the element **probably belongs** to the set with some probability.

I find the following post quite comprehensive ["What are Bloom filters, and why are they useful?" by Max Pagels][sc5-bloom-filter]. I couldn't do it better, take a look if you aren't familiar with Bloom filters.


### Why another Bloom filter?

Because available ones suck! :rage: They don't suit our needs because of performance and memory limitations. And you just know that you can do better. ~~Frankly, nothing is true. The reason is that you just get bored sometimes.~~ [(theme song)][youtube-bored]

All of them have size limitation caused by JVM array size limit. In JVM, arrays use integers for index, therefore the max size is limited by the max size of integers which is 2 147 483 647. If we create an array of longs to store bit than 64 bit * 2 147 483 647 = 137 438 953 408 bit we can store. This takes ~15 GB of memory. You can store ~10 000 000 000 elements with 0.1% probability.
Sure, you can create several Bloom filters or mod by hash but


#### Google's Guava

Guava is the best library I've seen. It works as expected. It's fast enough.
But... Surprisingly, It allocates!
Here's a list of [all allocations instrumented][github-allocation-instrumenter] during `mightContain()` call for 100 symbols string.

```
I just allocated the object [B@39420d59 of type byte whose size is 40 It's an array of size 23
I just allocated the object java.nio.HeapByteBuffer[pos=0 lim=23 cap=23] of type java/nio/HeapByteBuffer whose size is 48
I just allocated the object com.google.common.hash.Murmur3_128HashFunction$Murmur3_128Hasher@5dd227b7 of type com/google/common/hash/Murmur3_128HashFunction$Murmur3_128Hasher whose size is 48
I just allocated the object [B@3d3b852e of type byte whose size is 24 It's an array of size 1
I just allocated the object [B@14ba7f15 of type byte whose size is 24 It's an array of size 1
I just allocated the object sun.nio.cs.UTF_8$Encoder@55cb3b7 of type sun/nio/cs/UTF_8$Encoder whose size is 56
I just allocated the object [B@497fd334 of type byte whose size is 320 It's an array of size 300
I just allocated the object [B@280c3dc0 of type byte whose size is 312 It's an array of size 296
I just allocated the object java.nio.HeapByteBuffer[pos=0 lim=296 cap=296] of type java/nio/HeapByteBuffer whose size is 48
I just allocated the object [B@6f89ad03 of type byte whose size is 32 It's an array of size 16
I just allocated the object java.nio.HeapByteBuffer[pos=0 lim=16 cap=16] of type java/nio/HeapByteBuffer whose size is 48
I just allocated the object 36db757cdd5ae408ef61dca2406d0d35 of type com/google/common/hash/HashCode$BytesHashCode whose size is 16
```

This is 1016 bytes!! This is A LOT!!

It was fun to review. You can find some nice Easter eggs there. For example this one. It always is.

#### Twitter's Algebird

It's functional, immutable and monadic and very slooooow!!
String is universal format you know
It uses Murmur hash. takes 128 bit and splits it to 4 32 bit hashes. It sets bit for each 32 bit number. Which is quite disputable solution.
Performance? Pooooooor
What's interesting Twitter's Bloom filter uses EWAHCompressedBitmap under the hood which is  
normal sparse bitsets.
It's optimization for memory but it's really slow. because

uniform distribution
as uniform as better.

Here's what they say https://github.com/lemire/javaewah#when-should-you-use-compressed-bitmaps
Again, quite disputable solution in my opinion.

I performed rough tests to check total allocated memory.
I put 100,000 random 1000 symbols string to both Bloom filters, Twitter's and mine. And it appeared that Algebird allocated even more memory than the Bloom filter.

I won't post the list of all allocations because it's pretty long. Allocations for 100 symbol string is 1808 bytes. Assuming that we don't allocate new `EWAHCompressedBitmap`s

The only place where it might be worth to use Twitter's Bloom filter is distribute systems.


#### Breeze

"Breeze is a generic, clean and powerful Scala numerical processing library... Breeze is a part of ScalaNLP project, a scientific computing platform for Scala."

That sounds interesting, like a fresh wind. But...
There's [a surprise lurked inside.][github-breeze-hashcode] It takes a hash of the object. "WAT?? Where's beloved Murmur?" you ask. It's used only for "finalizing" the hash. for what, distribution? seriously? If you don't know that little nuance you are done with large datasets.

And again allocations - 544 bytes this time.
Scala specific TODO

```scala
for {
  i <- 0 to numHashFunctions
} yield {
  val h = hash1 + i * hash2
  val nextHash = if (h < 0) ~h else h
  nextHash % numBuckets
}
```

It compiles to:



#### Others

TODO

### How does it work?

Zero allocations - tricks with string

Uses unsafe to create huge arrays.
MurmurHash3
Generic version of it
Pluggable via implicit, type class pattern.
Contravariant implicits -> Dotty
Still have doubts?

```scala
implicit object CanGenerate128HashFromString extends CanGenerate128HashFrom[String] {

  import scala.concurrent.util.Unsafe.{instance => unsafe}

  private val valueOffset = unsafe.objectFieldOffset(classOf[String].getDeclaredField("value"))
  private val charBase = unsafe.arrayBaseOffset(classOf[Array[java.lang.Character]])

  override def generateHash(from: String): (Long, Long) = {
    val value = unsafe.getObject(from, valueOffset).asInstanceOf[Array[Char]]
    MurmurHash3Generic.murmurhash3_x64_128(value, charBase, from.length * 2, 0)
  }
}
```


Small, No dependencies TODO

Limitations:
CanGenerateHashFrom invariant
You need ot implement the hash function for you types by yourself.

Can I use it from Java?

Yes you can. Unfortunately, it won't be as nice as in Scala but you got used to it, uh? No implicits and compiler won't help you. Integration with Scala is ugly in some parts but it works.

```java
long expectedElements = 10000000;
double falsePositiveRate = 0.1;
BloomFilter<byte[]> bf = BloomFilter.apply(
        expectedElements,
        falsePositiveRate,
        CanGenerateHashFrom.CanGenerateHashFromByteArray$.MODULE$);

byte[] element = new byte[100];
bf.add(element);
bf.mightContain(element);
```


### Benchmarks

We all love benchmarks, right? Numbers in vacuum, they are cool. And here they are:

Warning: synthetic benchmarks in vacuum. The difference is more significant in production. GC stress.

No difference in element size, within statistic error
ThreadLocal - no difference in synthetic tests - Allocation is extremely cheap
I hope JVM will get structs during my dev life.


### When to use?

You are not satisfied with existing solutions.
High performance systems.
Systems with a lot of data and unique elements.


When not
You are ok with your current solution. Most software donâ€™t have to be fast.
You want to use only proven and battle tested libraries from loud names like Google or Twitter.
You want it to work out of the box.
