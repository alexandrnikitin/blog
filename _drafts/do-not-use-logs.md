witnessed an interesting event
do not rely on logs, don't even think about building business logic based upon logs
logging should not affect your app, no files, no tcp
do not log everything, only not expected cases
no logic in logging, no side effects
proper tools, structured logging, ELK
use metrics to know the system condition
